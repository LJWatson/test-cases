      <p>Most legal cases are brought in the USA because its laws are favourable, and the financial penalties imposed on
        organisations found to be in breach of those laws are substantial.</p>

      <p>Even though fewer cases reach court in other countries, significant damage can be done to an organisation&#39;s
