<p>This is a test case for a solution to a specific situation in which it is necessary to make a non-interactive element focusable in order to provide equivalent functionality to keyboard users (including screen reader users), that is otherwise available only to mouse users.</p>

<p>Making a non-interactive element focusable can cause confusion for screen reader users if they do not realise why a non-interactive element has received focus. Using <code>aria-role-description</code> is one potential technique that is being explored.</p>

<p>Use the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key to move focus onto the text below.</p>
