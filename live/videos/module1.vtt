00:00:02.933 --> 00:00:05.599
by TetraLogical for [CLIENT NAME].

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.833
This self-led training
has five modules

4
00:00:07.833 --> 00:00:11.499
that answer some fundamental
questions about accessibility.

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.266
What is accessibility?

6
00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.666
Who does accessibility benefit?

7
00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.666
How is accessibility measured?

8
00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:19.932
How is accessibility tested?

9
00:00:19.933 --> 00:00:23.266
and, Who is responsible
for accessibility?

10
00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:25.666
Once you've completed
all five modules,

11
00:00:25.666 --> 00:00:28.399
you'll be able to answer
these questions yourself.

12
00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.600
You'll also have a fundamental
understanding of accessibility,

13
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.733
to help you make it part of
everything you do at [CLIENT NAME].

14
00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:36.733
In this, the first
of five modules

15
00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.733
in the self-led Accessibility
Fundamentals training course,

16
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:43.499
we'll be asking the question,
what is accessibility?

17
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.000
It'll take about 10 minutes
to complete the module,

18
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.066
and by the end, you'll be able
to explain what accessibility is,

19
00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:50.732
and what it means for you,
for [CLIENT NAME]

20
00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:53.066
and for your target audience.
