<button aria-label="As the name suggests, a touch tour is an opportunity for blind and low vision theatre goers to explore the set and costumes by touch, before the play begins. In this case it took about 30 minutes, and given that set designer Miriam Buether has wrung every last ounce of possibility out of the revolving stage at the Phoenix theatre, I was profoundly glad of the opportunity.
If you haven't encountered one before, a revolving stage  consists of two or more concentric circles, each of which can be raised or lowered as well as revolved. At the Phoenix there is an outer ring that takes up most of the available space on the stage, an inner ring, and then a circular platform in the centre that is perhaps a meter or so across.
As the stage moves and revolves, one scene transitions fluidly into another, so the action never stops. Even with AD, it would have been incredibly hard
to understand what was happening on stage, but the touch tour was an opportunity to get amongst the different parts of the set and to understand how it worked.
The action in Stranger Things: The First Shadow moves from the room where Bob Newby broadcasts his home radio show, to a school gymnasium (complete with its own stage), a police station, locker room, local cafeteria, a church, the Creel house, and of course into the Upside Down.
The tour was conducted by Miranda and Willie, two AD specialists from Vocaleye  who later provided the live AD for the performance itself. They took us onto the stage and gave us an initial description of the set, then introduced us to Chris Buckley, the actor who plays Bob Newby. Chris told us all about Bob Newby's home radio broadcast station, complete with 50s era knobs and dials, an On Air sign fashioned out of a cornflake packet and a red light bulb, plus a xylophone, kazoo, and slide whistle for those all-important sound effects.
We were then introduced to Patrick Vaill, who plays Doctor Brenner. Patrick talked about playing a younger and slightly angrier version of the character played by Mathew Modine in the Netflix series, and about transforming himself into the suit wearing Doctor Brenner with short dark hair (Patrick Vaill has light coloured chin length hair and was casually dressed at the time).
We were then encouraged to explore the set for ourselves. It was extraordinary to be able to reach over the waist high wooden rail into the bullpen of
the police station and pat a Bakelite telephone, to step into the laboratory and sit on a hard metal chair in the centre of the harsh white space, to discover that when the row of lockers revolved out of sight the sinks and taps on their other side swivelled into view to become a bathroom, to feel the beer taps
on the bar of the cafeteria, and so much more besides. All the while Chris Buckley, Patrick Vaill, the AD specialists, and several members of the crew
were happy to chat and answer questions.
Louis McCartney, the actor who plays Henry Creel, then joined the tour. Louis explained that although he's in his early 20s, he has the build and appearance of a much younger person, enabling him to play an early teenage Henry Creel. Louis also described some of the scenes in which Henry Creel experiences some of the scarier moments in the play.
There was just time to feel some of the costumes that would be worn during the play, including a 1950s style hazmat suit, an evening gown covered in sequins, a showgirl outfit with tail feathers, and the head and clawed feet of a Demogorgon!
The tour wrapped up with a reminder to be in our seats 15 minutes before curtain-up if we wanted to listen to some audio notes before the play got underway.">Banana</button>
