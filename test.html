<h1>Scratch test case</h1>

<article>
<p>This page is designed to get Safari's Reader mode to kick-in. The purpose is to test whether Safari's Reader mode supports the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) <code>speak-as</code> property, as the VoiceOver screen reader seems to do.</p>
<h2>Testing speak-as</h2>
<p>The <code>speak-as</code> property is designed to let authors control the way speech output speaks certain types of content. For example, the <code>digits</code> value causes speech output to speak a number as a string of separate digits, instead of a whole large number. Here's an example:</p>
<p>This number should be spoken as digits: <span style="speak-as:digits;">01001110000</span>, and this number should not: 01001110000.</p>

<p>Another example is the <code>spell-out</code> value. This is intended to cause synthetic speech to speak a word one character at a time. Here is another example:</p>
<p>This acronym should be spoken on letter at a time: <span style="speak-as:spell-out;">NATO</span>, but this time it should not: NATO.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>No idea. I'm just typing words to take up space. Perhaps in time things will become clear.</p>
